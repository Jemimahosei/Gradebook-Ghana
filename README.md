# Gradebook Ghana - Ongoing


## Project Overview

The goal of  **Gradebook Ghana** is to streamline the academic management processes for **Ghanaian High Schools**, with a focus on assessment tracking and reporting. This system provides features for three key user roles: **students**, **teachers**, and **administrators**, ensuring that each group has the necessary tools to access or input academic data.

## Key Modules

### 1. Student Section
The **Student Section** is designed to allow students to view their academic performance over time, offering a clear understanding of their results. This helps students monitor their progress and identify areas where they need improvement. Each student can access their:

- **Profile**: Including their personal information like name, school, class, and contact details. This is important for both identification and communication.
- **Result History**: A comprehensive list of previous results, making it easier for students to see their academic trends over the years. The ability to print and share results via email or social media also encourages student ownership of their academic progress.
- **Dashboard**: This is where current performance data is displayed, offering students quick access to their grades for the term and subjects they are taking.

**Rationale**: A transparent view of academic history fosters student responsibility and enables them to track their progress over time. The ability to print or share reports adds flexibility, which is crucial for students who need to provide proof of performance to external parties.

### 2. Teacher Section
Teachers are the primary users responsible for inputting student assessments. The **Teacher Section** is tailored to help them efficiently manage their classes and assessments. Key features include:

- **Profile Management**: Allows teachers to update their information, including contact details and subjects they are teaching. This helps keep their profiles current and ensures effective communication.
- **Class and Student Management**: Teachers can view all their assigned classes and the students within those classes. This makes it easier for them to organize assessments by class.
- **Assessment Input**: Teachers can enter grades for continuous assessments, which are stored for each student in real-time. They can also manage and view their assessments and schedules through a user-friendly calendar interface.

**Rationale**: Simplifying the grading process for teachers reduces administrative burden and allows them to focus more on delivering quality education. Teachers can update grades efficiently and ensure that students have access to their results in a timely manner.

### 3. Admin Section
Administrators are the backbone of the system, with access to the most comprehensive set of features. They oversee the overall operation of the school and need tools to manage teachers, students, and assessment systems. Key features for administrators include:

- **School Profile**: Admins can manage the school's branding and contact information, ensuring that official school documents, like report cards, are properly branded.
- **Grading System Management**: Admins can update the grading scale, ensuring consistency across all classes and subjects.
- **Staff and Roles**: The ability to assign roles (e.g., head teacher, regular teacher) ensures that the right people have access to the right features.
- **Student Management**: Admins can view, edit, and organize student details, including assigning them to classes and ensuring they are linked to the appropriate subjects.
- **Classes and Subjects**: Admins can update class rosters, assign subjects to students and teachers, and ensure that assessments are aligned with the school’s curriculum.

**Rationale**: Administrators are responsible for the smooth functioning of the school. By centralizing student and teacher management, as well as grading systems, admins can easily make changes that affect the whole system without having to edit each student or teacher profile manually.

## Development Process

### 1. Initial Wireframes 
To ensure that the system meets the needs of all users, wireframes were be designed for the **student**, **teacher**, and **admin** sections. These wireframes served as blueprints, outlining the layout and functionality of each page. This process will be iterative, with time allocated for feedback and revisions:

**Rationale**: Wireframing ensures that the design is user-friendly before development begins. It’s easier and faster to make adjustments to wireframes than to make changes after coding has started.

## Color Theme and Branding

For the color scheme, a **primary green (#76B900)** and **white** theme was chosen. Green is often associated with growth, harmony, and success, making it a fitting choice for an educational platform. White helps keep the interface clean and easy to navigate.

- **Primary Color**: Green (#76B900) – conveys balance and a calm learning environment.
- **Secondary Color**: White – provides contrast and enhances readability.

**Rationale**: The green and white color scheme creates a professional yet approachable interface that aligns with the school’s branding and encourages ease of use.

## Estimated impact and current progress
  Estimated Impact

With feedback from the administration of several high schools in Ghana, particularly within the **Ashanti Region**, **Gradebook Ghana** is projected to make a significant impact on the education system. By optimizing the grading process and speeding up the delivery of results, it is estimated that **30% of Ghanaian high schools** will benefit from this platform. The system aims to streamline assessment workflows, reduce administrative bottlenecks, and provide students with quicker access to their results, fostering an improved learning environment.

### Key Benefits:
- **Efficiency in Grading**: Teachers will spend less time on manual grade entry, allowing for more focus on instruction and student engagement.
- **Faster Report Delivery**: Students and parents will receive academic reports in real-time, minimizing delays between assessments and feedback.
- **Data Accuracy**: By automating much of the grading process, errors associated with manual calculations will be significantly reduced, leading to more reliable performance reports.
- **Administrative Ease**: School administrators will have easier access to class data, allowing for more effective monitoring of school-wide performance and facilitating decision-making processes.

## Current Progress

We have made considerable strides in the development of **Gradebook Ghana**, with significant work completed on the **frontend**. The user interface for students, teachers, and administrators has been fully designed and implemented, providing a seamless and intuitive experience for all user roles.

Our current focus is on the **backend development**, which involves integrating **MongoDB** and **Next.js** to manage the system's database and server-side functionalities. These tools will ensure scalable, fast, and secure handling of user data, as well as efficient performance across various devices.

### Completed Milestones:
- **Frontend Development**: The entire UI for all user roles has been completed.
- **Initial Testing**: We’ve conducted frontend tests to ensure that the interface is responsive and user-friendly.
  
### Ongoing Tasks:
- **Backend Integration**: MongoDB is being used to store assessment data, user profiles, and grading schemas. Next.js is responsible for rendering server-side logic, ensuring real-time data updates and interactions between teachers, students, and the admin.
  
We are on track to deliver a fully functioning prototype soon, with plans to begin user testing in select high schools in the Ashanti Region.
